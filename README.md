# ExternalMedia

The `ExternalMedia` library provides a framework for interfacing external codes computing fluid properties to Modelica.Media-compatible component models.

## Library description

The ExternalMedia library provides a framework for interfacing external codes computing fluid properties to Modelica.Media-compatible component models.
It is compatible with Modelica Standard Library v 3.2, 3.2.1, and 3.2.2.

The current version of the library supports pure and pseudo-pure fluids models, possibly two-phase, compliant with the Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium interface.

The current release of the library (3.2.1) includes a pre-compiled interface to the [FluidProp](http://www.asimptote.nl/software/fluidprop) software and built-in access to [CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org).
If you use the FluidProp software, you need to have the proper licenses to access the media of your interest and to compute the property derivatives.

The released library has been tested with Dymola and OpenModelica under Windows as well as with Dymola on 32bit Linux. Support for more tools and operating systems might
be added in the future.

You can modify the library to add an interface to your own solver; if your solver is open-source, please contact the developers, we might add it to the official
ExternalMedia library.

The library is currently under development for a new release with improved functionality, see the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/modelica/ExternalMedia/wiki) for more info. 

## Current release

The last stable release is 3.2.1.
